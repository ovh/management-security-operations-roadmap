- You can **watch a given feature** to get email notifications when it is modified or moves forward
- You can **comment or vote** for listed features to influence our specifications and prioritization
- You can **suggest a new issue** to the backlog 

## Workflow
- New issues will be considered typically within a week and may enter one of the board's **Backlog** if they align with our product strategy.
- We regularly commit to new items on the backlog. "**Acknowledged**" column means that the feature have been review by OVHCloud staff that confirmed their relevance and alignment with our strategy.
- When the feature should be addressed within the next 12 months they are moved to "**Prioritized**".
- When the feature approach production, they are moved to "**Planned**". At that stage, specification are final, and the feature should be released within the next **3 months**
- In most cases, prior to General Availability features can be used by customers in Closed or Opened beta phase and/or in a limited way (partial functionality) so they are moved to "**Partially released**"
- After General Availability the feature are moved to "Done" and we will keep new features for a couple of months after their release in the "**Done**" column and you can retrieve the details in "**ChangeLog**" view.
  
## Proposing a new feature
- Consider only new features (aka functional enhancements, new localizations, UX improvments). Specific bug reports or support requests should be opened through  [the OVHcloud help center](https://help.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/ "the OVHcloud help center")
- If you believe you've found a security issue in our service, please enter our [bug bounty programm ](https://yeswehack.com/programs/ovh#rules "bug bounty programm ")
- Please consult [Existing issues](https://github.com/ovh/management-security-operations-roadmap/issues "Existing issues") and [product documentation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/ "product documentation") to avoid duplicates
- Please describe the feature in the shortest possible way, ideally as an agile user story
- We are interested in your use case associated and the current workaround you have found if they exist. Please comment your own issue with those details if possible.
